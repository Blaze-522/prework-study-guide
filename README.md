# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is my Prework Study Guide for my coding bootcamp. I made this to help me take notes and keep everything in one place. I also wanted to make sure I completed it so I could freshen up for the upcoming workload. Another reason I made it was because I need something to reference back to. I learned a good amount of javascript mainly for loops. As I had prior experience with HTML and CSS I also used this project to refresh myself on those languages.

## Usage

Each section of the webpage contains some notes about all of the coding languages that were used to make the webpage. Javascript wasn't used for anything actually on the webpage all of that is in the console logs which should be checked out. This has a feature that will choose what should be studied that day. The feature is random everytime it is refreshed so visiting it once a day will hopefully give you something new everytime you visit.
